RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release adds a dedicated phase for :ref:`targeted property-based testing <targeted-search>`,
and (somewhat) improves the targeting algorithm so that it will find higher quality results more reliably.
This comes at a cost of making it more likely to get stuck in a local optimum.
